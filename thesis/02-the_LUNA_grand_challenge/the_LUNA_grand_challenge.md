# The LUNA grand challenge

This chapter will serve as an introduction to what is the LUNA grand challenge, its dataset, competition tracks and metrics. After that is out of the way, I'll go over the current top 20 and do a survey of the different techniques that compound the state of the art for this kind of problem. This will serve as an introduction to what I amb about to do.

## The LUNA grand challenge
Lung cancer is the most deadly cancer in the world. Bring some figures and talk about trends. Explain why this was collected, essentially the whole reasoning behind it was to provide a good benchmark to easily compare CAD systems

## The LUNA dataset
Basically talk about the technique and how it has been changing diagnosis recently. This could be a copy pasta of @Arindra2017 and explain a bit on how they've reworked on the LIDC dataset to prepare the data, what it does and what is missing (malignancy!), which is actually available in LIDC.

## Grand challenge competition tracks
Talk about the tracks and metrics. Again, this appears in @Arindra2017, so I don't know how much I want to add

## A survey of the state of the art
Interesting to go over the top 20 of LUNA as it stands right now. Thankfully most of the systems are closed so I don't have to explain them, but for the open ones, it would be good to go over the methods they present, and basically argument why I chose what I did
Talk about the top 20. Basically put a table with the methods, describe them slightly. Then divide method by groups and expand more on that.
