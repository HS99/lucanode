# Integrating the CAD pipeline
\clearpage

Cover the necessary steps to package the system as a readymade product. Basically we have to automate
the preprocessing steps I've performed when training the network and then I am good to go.

Also, talk about the Dockerized thing and the support for GPU, etc. Basically important to have something easily deployable in production on-site or whatever really.

I'll need some performance numbers with my stuff to basically tell how much time I need to analyze a scan. Also, break down results by step as well. We want to know what is more expensive.
