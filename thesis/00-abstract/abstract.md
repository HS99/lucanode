# Abstract  {.unnumbered}

This Master's final thesis details the implementation of a computer-aided detection (CADe) system for lung cancer nodule  detection (hence *lucanode*). Its aim is to provide assistance to radiologists for early diagnosis of lung cancer by detecting round abnormalities in the lung (the nodules). The thesis contextualizes the impact that such a system could have in the prognosis for this disease, analyzes the current state of the art and then dwells on the implementation of the system, trained on the publically available LUNA dataset \[@Arindra2017\].

*lucanode* is divided into a 4 step pipeline: scan preprocessing, lung segmentation, nodule segmentation and false positive reduction. For each step, there are multiple attempted approaches, which have been quantified and evaluated against one another. Finally, the system as a whole is compared against the state of the art following the approach established in the LUNA grand challenge.

On the discussion we comment on the possible improvements for each step of the pipeline, as well as the steps that would be required to integrate it into a clinical workflow. We conclude the thesis by pointing to future lines of research to expand on the topic.

And this is where the acknowledgments section goes. I should write something nice.
