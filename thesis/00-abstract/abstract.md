# Abstract  {.unnumbered}

This Master's final thesis details the implementation of a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) for lung nodule detection. The aim of this system is to provide assistance to radiologists for early diagnosis of lung cancer. The system's pipeline consists of 4 main steps:

- scan preprocessing
- lung segmentation
- nodule segmentation
- false positive reduction

Each part of the system is assessed quantitatively. Also, the system as a whole is compared with the state of the art following the metrics established in the LUNA grand challenge.
